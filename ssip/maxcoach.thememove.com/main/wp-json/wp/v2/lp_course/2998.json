Those who knew of celiac disease were few and far between, and gluten-free products were a rare find on grocery store shelves. When I tried to order gluten-free food in a restaurant, people thought I was part of a cult or some strange religion.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now things are different. Gluten-free products are readily available almost everywhere we turn, though many of them are processed foods.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I started my gluten-free diet, I avoided processed foods and ate quite a bit of whole grains. However, even a healthy gluten-free diet did little to assuage my celiac disease symptoms. I was in constant digestive distress and felt far from healthy. Then I tried something new, taking my diet a step further: I went on a 100 percent grain-free Paleo diet. After three years of following the gluten-free diet and seeing little to no results, my gut started to heal quickly on the grain-free diet. I\u2019ve been strictly grain-free ever since.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Start building the life of your dreams today and say goodbye to stress, disorganisation and unhappiness.
