The good news is that\u2019s becoming very important! Econsultancy recently asked what the most important characteristic is in order to establish a truly \u201cdigital-native\u201d culture. The answer to that question and leading the responses with 58% was to be customer-centric.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p>Enroll in this course to find out.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now more than ever, corporations are investing heavily in IT.
