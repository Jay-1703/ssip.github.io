How much you eat\u2014and what you eat\u2014play central roles in maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight. Exercise is the other key actor.<\/p>\r\n<p>For years, low-fat diets were thought to be the best way to lose weight. A growing body of evidence shows that low-fat diets often don&#8217;t work, in part because these diets often replace fat with easily digested carbohydrates.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hundreds of diets have been created, many promising fast and permanent weight loss. Remember the cabbage soup diet? The grapefruit diet? How about the Hollywood 48 Hour Miracle diet, the caveman diet, the Subway diet, the apple cider vinegar diet, and a host of forgettable celebrity diets.<\/p>\r\n<p>The best diet for losing weight is one that is good for all parts of your body, from your brain to your toes, and not just for your waistline. It is also one you can live with for a long time. In other words, a diet that offers plenty of good tasting and healthy choices, banishes few foods, and doesn&#8217;t require an extensive and expensive list of groceries or supplements.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Start building the life of your dreams today and say goodbye to stress, disorganisation and unhappiness.
