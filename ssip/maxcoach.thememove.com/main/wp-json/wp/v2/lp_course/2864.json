The goal of this course is to provide the learner with a rich learning experience through &#8220;easy to digest&#8221; modules consisting of video demonstrations and accompanying ebooks. Designed for beginner and intermediate artists, this course lays the foundation required for success with portrait drawing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it. Portrait drawing can be intimidating to some. You sit down to draw a representational drawing of a person and something goes horribly wrong along the way. You&#8217;re not sure what happened, but you know that the drawing you just created just doesn&#8217;t quite look like the person. Fortunately, this doesn&#8217;t have to be case. With a bit of knowledge, practice, and few &#8220;secrets&#8221; used by the pros, accurate and realistic portrait drawings can be created by anyone &#8211; including you!<\/p>\r\n<p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Learn portrait drawing in easy steps - part 1: always starts from composition\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/36_AwMmPWxs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><\/p>\r\n<p>This course has been designed to accelerate learning by teaching to many different learning styles. Not all of us prefer to learn from watching videos. Some of us prefer to learn from books as well as videos. Each course module includes an illustrated ebook that corresponds with the video. Every step and concept is clearly illustrated and described in each downloadable ebook. The ebooks are a fantastic compliment to the comprehensive videos.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"audience\" data-purpose=\"course-audience\">\r\n<div class=\"audience__title\">Who this course is for:<\/div>\r\n<ul class=\"audience__list\">\r\n<li>Anyone who wants to learn how to draw accurate portraits.<\/li>\r\n<li>Beginner and Intermediate art students will love the simplicity and clarity in which the lessons are presented.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This course gives you the knowledge required to create accurate portraits by exploring the &#8220;ins and outs&#8221; of each feature, the underlying structure of the face, how light effects the form of the face, strategies for locating facial proportions, and techniques used by artists and illustrators to ensure accuracy every time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2865,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","course_category":[89],"course_tag":[90],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lp_course\/2864"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lp_course"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/lp_course"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2864"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lp_course\/2864\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3197,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lp_course\/2864\/revisions\/3197"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2865"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2864"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"course_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/course_category?post=2864"},{"taxonomy":"course_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/course_tag?post=2864"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
