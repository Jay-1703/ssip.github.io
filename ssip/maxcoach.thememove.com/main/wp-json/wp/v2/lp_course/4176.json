A bridge between how our brain works and how to use that knowledge to improve our communication and leadership abilities.<\/p>\r\n<p>To understand how and why Leadership works, we first need to understand what triggers us. We\u2019ll be diving deep into our subconscious motivational processes. We\u2019ll have a look at our brain, call it our \u2018hardware\u2019 and the subconscious programs running in it, that\u2019s basically our software.<\/p>\r\n<p>So expect tools, concrete, and simple tools that you will be able to use right away with your team and colleagues. In the end, the aim of this course is to open the way for a new understanding of motivation and communication, towards a new, highly effective and sustainable model for leadership in this 21st century.<\/p>\r\n<p>But most of all, by the end of this course, my aim is that you, as a manager, as a leader, will have understood what a crucial role you play in your team and in its success. And that you will be able to leverage that knowledge and guide your team to a new level of collaboration and engagement.<\/p>\r\n<p><div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Neuroscience and Leadership\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cq4nUqEHiIA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><\/p>\r\n<p>I will provide a framework based on the latest insights in cognitive psychology and related fields.
