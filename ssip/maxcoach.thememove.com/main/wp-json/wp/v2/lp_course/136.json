It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The emphasis in this course is on hands-on and practical learning. As such, you will work with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. You will create a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs, you will practice building and running SQL queries. You will also learn how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone can audit this course at no-charge. If you choose to take this course and earn the Coursera course certificate, you can also earn an IBM digital badge upon the successful completion of the course.<\/span><\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Much of the world&#8217;s data resides in databases.
