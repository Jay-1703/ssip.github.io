Effective learning management systems can empower departments and enable business growth, as well as further educational initiatives. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> Unlike the human researchers, the computer program was able to identify about twice as many systems. However, after additional investigation, the human researchers successfully confirmed about 97% of the info provided by Kimmon\u2019s program. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, LMS has become a vital tool to achieve enterprise learning objectives. It is no wonder the LMS market will be worth $<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/press-releases\/2019-01-07\/lms-market-worth-22-4-billion-by-2023-exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets\">22.4 billion by 2023<\/a>. Learning management systems, for instance, can be used in several formats. You can use it as a formal, experimental, or social managerial compliance training program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the role of eLearning to generate revenue for enterprises continues to evolve. LMS personalizes feedback to promote a self-regulating learning process. In fact, LMS has been proven to increase the effectiveness of students\u2019 and employees\u2019 learning outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Evolving Role of the Learning Management System<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A revolutionary change in the LMS is the contextualization of the learning process for teachers and employers. The right LMS can enable increased interaction between instructors and learners. Consequently, a collaborative virtual learning experience improves outcomes for online learners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adoption of LMS by K-12 Schools<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is true \u2013 the skepticism towards LMS no longer exists. And why would it? The majority of institutions have successfully implemented the systems in higher education to improve student\u2019s learning process. Similarly, LMS is now widely used by K-12 schools. It does, however, present an opportunity for researchers to learn the standardized testing process at such a scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s interesting is that the adoption of an LMS solution goes beyond higher standardized test scores. However, this effectiveness is interconnected with the cost and nature of the system itself. For example, an education system should have a proprietary system configuration, while an open-source solution is preferable for an organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Source:  blogs.onlineeducation.touro.edu<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, organizations and academic institutes require robust and strategic learning management systems (LMS) that can automate manual processes of traditional tools.
