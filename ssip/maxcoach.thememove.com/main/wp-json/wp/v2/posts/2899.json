Doyle<\/a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thisiscolossal.com\/?s=adam+s+doyle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">previously<\/a>) is known for his paintings of birds and other animals that call attention to, rather than mask, his brush strokes. In his latest series, \u201cNight Fall Trees,\u201d Doyle shifts his focus to a different living entity. \u201cBy putting trees front and center as subjects, instead of relegating them to the background where they usually are, I\u2019m saying these silent sentinels of our planet deserve our full attention and respect,\u201d the artist shares with Colossal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like his other series, \u201cNight Fall Trees\u201d centers on Doyle\u2019s obsession with energy. The swirling tree branches are wound tightly within each other, the tufts of leaves envelop the top branches, and the widespread roots bury themselves into the ground. Inspired by a nighttime glimpse of a well-lit tree last October, Doyle also says this series is about the seasons and the resilience the trees have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Fall is often associated with colorful foliage, which is best seen during the day. But fall is also a season about transition, heading in for the long nights and bone-chilling cold. Winter is a hard time. Trees get through it, though. These paintings reflect on being ready for what\u2019s to come and like the trees knowing we\u2019ll get through it. There will be blossoming once again in the spring.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Doyle tells Colossal his creative plans include writing fiction and nonfiction.
