Over the long-term, relaxation can mitigate certain health issues, including hypertension, anxiety and even cancer (Esch,&nbsp;Fricchione&nbsp;&amp; Stefano, 2003; Keefer &amp; Blanchard, 2002),&nbsp;in addition to&nbsp;improving&nbsp;overall health and healing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some mindful practices that you and your clients might want to try:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Mindful movement, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, walking or cycling:<\/em>&nbsp;Your clients might be surprised to learn that one of the two common aspects of practices that elicit relaxation is repetition (Benson &amp;&nbsp;Klipper, 1975), as is experienced during&nbsp;exercises like&nbsp;walking and cycling.&nbsp;<\/li><li><em>Meditation:<\/em>&nbsp;This can include any of&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;types of meditation, which you should encourage your clients to research. While some people thrive with an ongoing transcendental meditation practice, others may simply want&nbsp;a way to get&nbsp;10 or 15 minutes of quiet&nbsp;time or prayer&nbsp;during a stressful period. This is where the second aspect of practices that elicit relaxation comes in\u2014a passive disregard of thoughts as they arise (Benson &amp;&nbsp;Klipper, 1975).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li><em>Breathing exercises:<\/em>&nbsp;Again, there are&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;breathing exercises that clients can explore, including diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sleep<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep disorders&nbsp;are common in modern society, with&nbsp;one in three U.S. adults reporting that they usually get less than the recommended amount of sleep&nbsp;(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018).

Inadequate sleep has been linked to a variety of health risks, including heart disease, weight gain, depression and&nbsp;reduced cognitive function.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Share the following tips with your clients to help them get a good night\u2019s sleep (American Sleep Foundation, 2018):&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Create a relaxing sleep environment&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Follow a consistent sleep schedule&nbsp;<\/li><li>Follow a soothing bedtime routine&nbsp;<\/li><li>Limit exposure to bright light, especially blue light&nbsp;<\/li><li>Try to be exposed to natural light early in the day&nbsp;<\/li><li>Exercise daily&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Avoid caffeine and alcohol&nbsp;<\/li><li>Avoid eating a large meal to close to bedtime&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Social Connectedness<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many of us are feeling isolated, lonely, anxious or depressed right now. As a health coach or exercise professional, one of the best things you can do is provide a positive experience each time you interact with a client. Also, remind them that none of us are in this alone, and that the importance of social connectedness cannot be overstated. Encourage them to use Facetime,&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;or&nbsp;another video conferencing tools&nbsp;to interact with friends and family members or to reach out to people they may have lost touch with over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People all over the world are having virtual dance parties, taking classes online, attending virtual happy hours and finding other&nbsp;creative&nbsp;ways&nbsp;to have fun&nbsp;and&nbsp;take a break from the craziness we\u2019re all living through. We may all be isolated in our homes&nbsp;at the moment, but we need each other more than ever. That\u2019s great advice to share with clients\u2014and to be mindful of yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Source:  <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.myfitnesspal.com\/\">acefitness.org<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the upside, there are still plenty of ways that you and your clients can practice self-care during these troubling times, even if you\u2019re under orders to stay at home as much as possible.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2252,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"pmpro_default_level":0},"categories":[81],"tags":[80],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2273"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2273"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2273\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2470,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2273\/revisions\/2470"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2252"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2273"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2273"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/maxcoach.thememove.com\/main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2273"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
