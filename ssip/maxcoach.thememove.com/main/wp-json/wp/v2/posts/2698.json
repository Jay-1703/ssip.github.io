But in order to do that, you need to be intentional about establishing who you are and what it\u2019s like to work with you. Think of this as your brand tattoo. It\u2019s something timeless that never leaves you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Only accept projects that are on-brand.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When a new opportunity presents itself, ask yourself:&nbsp;<em>Is this on-brand for me? Will this contribute to the impact I intend to make?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re off-brand, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re chasing shiny objects because you\u2019re out of alignment. When you\u2019re on-brand, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re in flow because you\u2019re making an authentic contribution toward your intended impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Get inspiration from other leaders and influencers who are not in your industry.&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Resist the temptation to focus only on your competitors\u2014you\u2019re likely to fall into the trap of imitating someone else. Instead, seek ideas from outside your industry. Don\u2019t copy, but gain inspiration and strategy that you can uniquely translate into your own work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, I\u2019ve always been fascinated by how comedians brand themselves with a style of joke. I\u2019m not a comedian, but I can apply that strategy to what I do.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Remember: What got you here won\u2019t get&nbsp;you there.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your brand should be timeless, but the way you translate it will change over time. Think about the brand you visualized at the beginning of this article. Have their product offerings changed? Has their messaging changed over time? Has their aesthetic changed?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remain open to being taken in a fresh direction while also staying true to your principles and area of impact.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, visualize your own brand tattoo.
