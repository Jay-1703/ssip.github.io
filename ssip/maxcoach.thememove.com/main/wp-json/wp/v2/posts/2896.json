The Brooklyn-based pattern designer and illustrator of&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ohkiistudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ohkii Studio<\/a>&nbsp;documents the lush scenery, cavernous waters, and hilly villages she sees on the streets of Lagos, Calamosche Beach on Italy\u2019s southern coast, and in Joshua Tree National Park. Mckay generally positions her miniature paintings against the real-life backdrop, juxtaposing the two depictions that she then shares on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ohkiistudio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The artist tells Colossal that she frequently recreates some of the pieces in her sketchbooks on a larger scale after returning home, relying on her earlier representation for the tiny details she otherwise might not remember. \u201cOften when I\u2019m traveling, I have this urgent feeling that I need to capture everything I\u2019m experiencing, the sights, feelings and textures of a place,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I really enjoy that feeling of walking around a new place not knowing what I might discover around the corner. I often try to recreate the feeling of a place I have visited in my personal work\u2026 I really enjoy the experience of looking at a painting and being transported back to that experience. It\u2019s a nice way to escape from your day to day!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The pocket-size notebooks are a crucial component of Mckay\u2019s process, and she utilizes them in both her personal projects and her work for clients. \u201cThey just allow me to play with ideas and explore other directions without having to commit to anything,\u201d she says.
