According to survey results published&nbsp;by the university ranking website Best Colleges, 59% of students who enroll in online education programs have children and 50% of them are employed. They highly value the opportunity to study when they can, as lectures are typically archived for later reference, making compulsory campus attendance a thing of the past. Also, they can work faster or slower on course material, depending on their current needs and understanding of the subject matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>High-quality student-tutor interactions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another advantage of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/thetrendsnext.com\/technology-is-redefining-education-heres-how\/\">online education<\/a>&nbsp;is improved communication between students and tutors. A study by California State University in San Bernardino<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nitrocollege.com\/blog\/online-college\/why-online-education-better\">found<\/a>&nbsp;that although people who study online absorb knowledge equally well as those who go to class, they\u2019re more active in discussions and enjoy a better interaction with instructors. Technologies such as video conferencing and VOIP calls make it easy to communicate with people across the world. Online students also benefit from more frequent assessments, with professors able to spot knowledge gaps faster and provide suggestions on how to move forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> Source:  blogs.onlineeducation.touro.edu <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>High quality education can make all the difference in people\u2019s lives.
